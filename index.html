                    <h2>real beauty resides in imperfection</h2>
                    <p>In a digital era, we sometimes feel the need to interact with something more human that will
                        make
                        us appreciate both the
                        beauty and the imperfection of something made by hand.</p>

                    <h2>expressiveness is... the new black</h2>
                    <p>This series of illustrations paradoxically combines absurdity and a deep sense of
                        childishness
                        and naivety.</p>

            <p>Welcome to my space for experiments! Look at this like a journey we can take together every step of
                the way, beginning
                another chapter with each new phase of the project development. And who knows where it will take us?

            <p>Each illustration offers the possibility of limitless interpretations and uses and everyone can give
                it its own meaning.
                It depends only on each one's creativity and free spirit.</p>
